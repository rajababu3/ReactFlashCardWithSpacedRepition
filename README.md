## Source Files Description

This is a simple flashcard app which is developed using react and redux.

Main concept behind this app is that I am using spaced repetition.

## Process

1. Create a Deck with +New Deck Button
2. Then Click on that deck to add cards
3. You can add cards or study cards if cards are there.
4. Spaced repetition allows user to study deck based on how they did while studying a card.
5. Suppose a user did poor then he/she is allowed to study that card in next day, if he did well then he is again allowed to study
    that card after 3 days, this is what space repetition says.
